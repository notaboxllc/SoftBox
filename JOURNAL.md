## 2026-06-13 — Increment 0: workspace scaffolded
Soft Box repo initialized at `~/Code/SoftBox` as a new repo (not a BoA branch). Frozen-v1 reference
set up as a read-only `git worktree` at `~/Code/BoA-v1ref`, detached at tag
`softbox-filref-2026-06-13` (pinned at v1 `main` HEAD; will re-point to `biology-production-v1` once
the v1 finish line is reached). `CLAUDE.md` seeded with the architecture invariants (integer-ID
entities, SoA component arrays as source of truth, systems as free functions, device residency from
day one), the reference/oracle discipline (fixtures frozen as data, not v1 code; read current main
for physics; reconciliation on v1 physics changes), the porting discipline (force-coverage audit,
minimal-repro first), and the proposed increment sequence (filament slice first). No physics yet.

Open / next: increment 1 — planner to design the FilSegment component-array layout + rigid-rod
Langevin integration system, with the v1 deflection / relaxation / LP benchmarks as the fixture.
